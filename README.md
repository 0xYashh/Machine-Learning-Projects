# Machine Learning Project
Heyya !!!  This is where I document and share my progress as I learn machine learning. I’ll be uploading my codes, experiments, and projects here, along with proper documentation to track my learning and growth.


## What’s in This Repository?
- **Code**: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for various machine learning tasks.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the concepts, algorithms, and steps involved in each project.

## Current Project: Iris Flower Classification
- **Description**: A k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their features.
- **Tools Used**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Results**: Achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.
